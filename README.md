<p align="center">An AirBnB clone.</p>


The console is the first segment of the AirBnB project at Holberton School that will collectively cover fundamental concepts of higher level programming.
#### Goals.
The main goal of AirBnB project is to eventually deploy our server a simple copy of the AirBnB Website(HBnB). To make this possible, we will perform the following steps:
* Create a command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging) (built in this segment).

*  A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data (data = objects)
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

#### Functionalities of this command interpreter:
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc...
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object


## Command Sytax and Usage:

Command | Syntax | Output
------- | ------ | ------
help | `help [option]` | Lists all available commands, or displays what option does
quit | `quit` | Exit command interpreter
EOF | `EOF` | Exit command interpreter
create | `create [class_name]` | Creates an instance of class_name
update | `update [class_name] [object_id] [update_key] [update_value]` | Updates the key:value of class_name.object_id instance
show | `show [class_name] [object_id]` | Displays all attributes of class_name.object_id
all | `all [class_name]` | Displays every instance of class_name, if used without option displays every instance saved to the file
destroy | `destroy [class_name] [object_id]` | Deletes all attributes of class_name.object_id
count | `count [class_name]` | Counts all the instances with class name specified

### Using the Console

The HolbertonBnB console can be run both interactively and non-interactively. 
To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution 
of the file `console.py` at the command line.

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb) 
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb) 
$
```

## Testing :straight_ruler:

Unittests for the HolbertonBnB project are defined in the [tests](./tests) 
folder. To run the entire test suite simultaneously, execute the following command:

```
$ python3 unittest -m discover tests
```

Alternatively, you can specify a single test file to run at a time:

```
$ python3 unittest -m tests/test_console.py
```
